MediaMon
========

File monitor and auto-indexer for Synology DiskStation NAS.

I'm using this on a DS213j, but I expect it may work on other models
as well (DS214+ was reported successfully for one).


Usage
-----

1. Install Python from the DiskStation package manager.

2. SSH into your DiskStation as root (e.g. ``ssh root@192.168.1.20`` -- use the
   right IP address for your DiskStation) and install pyinotify::

    cd /root/
    wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pyinotify/pyinotify-0.9.4.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf pyinotify-0.9.4.tar.gz
    cd pyinotify-0.9.4/
    python setup.py install

3. Copy ``mediamon.py`` to the DiskStation's ``/root/`` directory (``scp
   mediamon.py root@192.168.1.20:/root/``).

4. Copy ``S99mediamon.sh`` to the DiskStation's ``/usr/syno/etc/rc.d/``
   directory (``scp S99mediamon.sh
   root@192.168.1.20:/usr/syno/etc/rc.d/``).

5. SSH into the DiskStation again and run ``chmod 755 /usr/syno/etc/rc.d/S99mediamon.sh``,
   then ``/usr/syno/etc/rc.d/S99mediamon.sh start`` to start up the monitor.

6. Add some media files to ``/volume1/photo``, ``/volume1/music``, or
   ``/volume1/video``, and check the log at ``/var/log/mediamon.log`` to verify
   that it's working. You should see a ``synoindex -a`` entry for each added
   file.

Note: To change the default watched folders, you can add
/etc/mediamon/mediamon.ini (adapt to your needs):

[main]

# logging file
logfile = /var/log/mediamon.log
# pid file
pidfile = /var/run/mediamon.pid
# list of space separated paths to watch
watched_paths = /volume1/video /volume1/tech-conf /volume1/foobar
# list of space separated allowed extensions
allowed_exts = jpg jpeg png tga gif bmp ogg ogv mp4 avi m4v
# excluded pattern filter
exclude_dir_patterns = @eaDir .sync .stfolder


Caveats
-------

I've noticed I have to repeat steps 2-5 after any DSM upgrade. There may be a
way to avoid this by placing files in some other location that isn't wiped out
by DSM upgrades, but so far I haven't looked into it. I don't think
``S99mediamon.sh`` would work to restart the monitor after reboot if placed
anywhere else.

Suggestions, improvements, bug reports or pull requests welcome!
